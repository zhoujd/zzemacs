## Youtube does not automatically play the video when i open it in a new tab

```
This is because of Firefox's new autoplay blocking feature.
You can allow YouTube to automatically start playing videos by giving it permission (see the page I linked).
You will also need to set the 'media.block-autoplay-until-in-foreground' preference to false in the
Configuration Editor(about:config) to allow Firefox to start playing videos in background tabs.
