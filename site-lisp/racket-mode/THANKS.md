# Acknowledgements

- The existing Emacs Scheme mode and Inferior Scheme mode.

- The source code for for [Quack] by Neil Van Dyke provided a model
  for many of the scheme-indent-function settings, smart paren
  closing, and pretty lambda.

- The source code for [Geiser] by Jose A. Ortega Ruiz helped me
  understand how to support completions and especially company-mode.
  In addition, I was able to make heavy use of [gcr's pull request to
  Geiser] for displaying images in the REPL.
