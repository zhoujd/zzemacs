Ranger
======

## Install ranger

    $ sudo apt install ranger

## Copy and Paste files

    To copy a file, press yy. Then, to paste it, press ppdd.
    You can select multiple files with the space bar before pressing yy or dd to copy or move multiple files at once
    If you want to move multiple files across different directories, you can use ya and da to add each grouping to a list of files being relocated.

## How can I move all `marked` files to another directory in ranger

    use space to mark files i.e "toggle=true"
    use yt to yank files flagged as "toggle=true"
    enter the directory you want
    use pp to paste toggled files
    use dt instead of yt to cut instead of copy
