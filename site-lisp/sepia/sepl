=head1 NAME

C<sepl> -- a Term::ReadLine-based Sepia interactive shell.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ sepl
    Type ",h" for help, or ",q" to quit.
    main @> substr "hello, japh", 7
    'japh'
    main @>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<sepl> uses L<Sepia::ReadLine> to provide an interactive Perl shell
with many of the L<Sepia> features available in Emacs, including
completion and all shortcuts.  It is not well-tested or frequently
used, and should be considered experimental.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Sepia>, L<Term::ReadLine>.

Most of C<Sepia>'s documentation is installed in Emacs' C<info>
format.  On most systems it can be read from the command-line by
typing "C<info sepia>".
