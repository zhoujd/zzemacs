zzemacs - emacs for Zachary Zhou
================================

* Install emacs configure with script

    run script install.sh on linux.
	
    run bat script setup.bat on windows.
	
    also run following command line from emacs.
	
    emacs --script libexec/init-setup.el
	
    before you setup zzemacs configure you should
    check path setting in script.
